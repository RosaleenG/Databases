The following prject covers a series of business intelligence queries in SQL on a dataset about food businesses in San Francisco.

Working with a relational dataset, that captures information about food health investigations carried out in San Francisco and their outcomes.

The function of the business intelligence queries is to inform the start up of a new restaurant in San Francisco. 

The new start up will want to stay away from big restaurant owners who own multiple restaurants. 

The start up will also need to be in an area that is trending (Hence, alot of restaurants).

This project covers SQL queries to find out the best area and answer business intelligence questions.

The database is stored under data/sfscores.sqlite

The database consists of 3 tables. The schemas are shown below.

businesses: information relating to restaurant businesses
inspections: information about individual inspection events
violations: information about violation events
The queries increase in difficulty. By the end of this project, the focus will be on answering multipart business questions using multistep queries or multiple tables.
